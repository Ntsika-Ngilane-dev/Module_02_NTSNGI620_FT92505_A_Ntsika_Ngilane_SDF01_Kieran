Hi, I'm Ntsika Ngilane! I'm an aspiring software developer with a growing passion for building efficient and creative software solutions. While I'm still early in my journey, I have gained some experience working on a few development projects and continuously strive to improve my skills. This repository is part of my coursework and represents one of my first steps into version control and collaborative coding using Git. I'm excited to keep learning and growing from here!
